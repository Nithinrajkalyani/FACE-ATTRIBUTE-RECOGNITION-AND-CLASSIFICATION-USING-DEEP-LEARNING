# Face-Attribute-Recognition-And-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning

## Major Project
## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a face attribute recognition system designed to enhance security in critical locations such as universities, airports, ATMs, and border control points. Traditional security measures often face limitations in accurately identifying individuals, highlighting the need for advanced technology solutions.

Our solution integrates state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for precise face attribute recognition, addressing complexities such as facial accessories (e.g., goggles, masks, mustaches, and beards). By leveraging LabelMe PNG images and deep learning models like ResNet34, we have developed a comprehensive system capable of accurately identifying and classifying individuals based on their facial attributes.

## Features
- **Precise Recognition**: Our system accurately identifies facial attributes such as goggles, masks, mustaches, and beards.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Utilizes deep learning models like ResNet34 for robust performance.
- **Easy Integration**: Predicted attributes are output as yes or no, facilitating seamless integration into existing security infrastructure.
- **Rigorous Testing**: The system undergoes rigorous training and testing to ensure effectiveness and generalization across diverse scenarios.
- **Enhanced Security**: Provides an essential tool for preventing unauthorized access and strengthening security protocols in real-world applications.
